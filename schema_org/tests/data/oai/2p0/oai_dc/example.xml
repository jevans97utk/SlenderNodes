          <dc:description>The Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies Environmental Monitoring Program is a long-term data collection program designed to understand how the environment changes over time. The program includes monitoring of climate including temperature and precipitation, as well as variables related to air pollution, such as acid deposition and ozone, and water pollution and other streamwater chemistry. Our solar radiation monitoring includes diffuse and global photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), diffuse and global shortwave radiation, net radiation and UV. Long-term monitoring of solar radiation provides us with an understanding of atmospheric energy dynamics, which can affect natural and human systems. The Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, Environmental Monitoring Program furnishes data under the following conditions: The data have received quality assurance scrutiny by our program, and, although we are confident of the accuracy of these data, the Cary Institute will not be held liable for errors in these data. Data are subject to change resulting from updates in data screening or models used.
